Ambient Vertical Blinds Simulation

The XCode project will build a _.saver_ file and copy it into _~/Library/Screen Savers_ to enable immediately trying it out by selecting it in the the _Desktop and Screen Saver_ section of System Preferences.

The _.pde_ file is a [Processing 3.0])(https://processing.org/) sketch. You will need to install Minim from _Sketch > Import Library... > Add Library..._ if you don't already have it.

Executables and the Saver can be downloaded from the [itch.io project page](https://damikyu.itch.io/blinds).

Enjoy!
